Welcome to The Budgeter App!

This app is designed with the intent of tracking your dollars so you know where you are spending your hard earn money.

To use the app, all you have to do is click the link "https://mybudgeter.netlify.app/" and begin inputting your purchases after clicking on the top right button called "New Transaction". Once clicked, users will be moved to a form where they can input the item's: name, amount, company, and category along with the date of purchase. Remember, all inputs must be filled in or else, you will not be able to successfully submit.

After the deed is done, users will be moved back to a transaction list page, where all transactions inputted will be accessible with the total amount spent shown at the top of the screen. 

Users also have the ability to click on specific items to view and manage the information added. If any mistakes were made when inputting any information, an edit button is available for users to make any changes at their discretion. A delete button, with a trash icon,is also added if you want to get rid of a transaction in general. 

Enjoy!
